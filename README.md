This is just the shell. You will need to collect a few dependencies for it to fully work.
The collected list of dependencies is below:
<br>
```
matugen quickshell upower ttf-space-mono-nerd
```
You'll need to install the Google Sans Flex font for proper display of interface elements
<br>
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Google+Sans+Flex
<br>
move the downloaded font to ```/usr/share/fonts/TTF```
<br>
## Todo:
  - Install script
  - Dynamic theme management & actual implementation of JSON themes
  - Login & lock screen
  - Make skeletal powermenu buttons... not skeletal
