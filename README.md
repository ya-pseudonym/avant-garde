A robust and extensible desktop shell made with Quickshell, built for hyprland.
This is just the shell. You will need to collect a few dependencies for it to fully work.
The collected list of dependencies is below:
```
matugen & quickshell
```
You'll need to install the Google Sans Flex font for proper display of interface elements:

Todo:
  Install script
  Dynamic theme management & actual implementation of JSON themes
  Login & lock screen
  Make skeletal powermenu buttons... not skeletal
